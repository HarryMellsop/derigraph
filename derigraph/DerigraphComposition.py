    # how do we structure the data internally?  needs to be a graph structure.  variables are going to need to have names, and relationships in
    # the hierarchy.  Search tree needs to be implemented to perform sanity checking on whether or not the calculus requested is actually possible

    # what are the various steps that we need to follow here?  Firstly, we're going to need a way to create a calculation tree of a given mathematical expression
